# ðŸš€ Spring-Boot-Devops

Welcome to the comprehensive Spring Boot project that showcases best practices in development, testing, version control, and continuous delivery.

## Overview

In this project, we cover various aspects of software development and deployment:

### 1. Spring Boot Application Management

We manage the Spring Boot application using **Maven**, ensuring a structured and organized development process.

### 2. Source Code and Version Control

The source code is diligently tracked and version-controlled using **Git**, with **GitHub** serving as the central hosting service. This enables collaboration, code review, and efficient management of the codebase.

### 3. Backend Services Testing

Testing is a crucial aspect of the development process. We utilize **Mockito** to conduct thorough testing of the backend services, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the application.

### 4. Code Quality Assurance

Maintaining high code quality is essential. **SonarQube** is integrated into the pipeline to analyze and assess the quality of the code. **Jacoco** is used to measure code coverage, providing insights into the effectiveness of the tests.

### 5. Artifact Hosting

Artifacts produced during the development process are hosted on **Nexus3**. This ensures a centralized repository for the project's dependencies and releases.

### 6. Continuous Delivery

The project follows a continuous delivery approach. We create a **Docker image** using a **Dockerfile** from the artifact hosted on Nexus and deploy it on **DockerHub**. This allows for efficient and automated delivery of the application.

### 7. Containerization

We embrace containerization by using **Docker Compose** to orchestrate the deployment of the deliverables. This includes containerizing Spring Boot and MySQL, simplifying the deployment process.

### 8. Email Notification

Stay informed about the status of the pipeline through **email notifications**. This feature enhances communication within the development team and ensures prompt response to any issues that may arise during the development process.

### 9. Data Tracking and Visualization

For effective monitoring and visualization of the application's performance, we integrate **Prometheus** and **Grafana**. This provides valuable insights into the runtime behavior of the application and helps identify potential areas for improvement.

## Getting Started

To quickly get started and experience the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone github.com/Adam-khalfaoui/Spring-Boot-Devops.git
   
2. Run Docker Compose to deploy the application:
    ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
    
   This command will orchestrate the deployment of the Spring Boot application and MySQL database using Docker Compose. The -d flag runs the containers in the background.
3. Access the application:
   Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application at http://localhost:your-port.
   Note: Customize your-port with the port specified in your Docker Compose file.
